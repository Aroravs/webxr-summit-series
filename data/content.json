Her clients have included NASA, the University of Southern California\u2019s Institute for Creative Technologies (USC\/ICT), XPRIZE and the Army Medical Command.\n\nHer ongoing research focuses on how immersion can affect and benefit participants, how the use of Avatars changes both our social connections and our deep understanding of our sense of self, and how multisensory elements combine to create a cognitive gestalt that enhances the feelings of Presence in virtual experiences.\n\nHer 2007 PhD thesis \u2013 Meaning and Emplacement in Expressive Immersive Virtual Environments \u2013 has been downloaded hundreds of times by emerging VR communities, serving as a deep first introduction and guide to the many important aspects of this new medium, from its female-centric history to a design methodology for emotional impact. It was completed under the supervision of Dr Lizbeth Goodman at the SMARTlab Digital Media Institute University College Dublin, Ireland.\n\nDr Morie is a long time educator, having created digital programs at the University of Central Florida, the Ringling College of Art and Design, and Otis College of Art and Design. She is the original developer of the first computer animation training program for Walt Disney Feature Animation in the 1990s, as well as similar training programs for companies in the Digital Effects industries, such as Rhythm and Hues Studios. She is a former member of the DARPA ISAT Group, tasked with investigating new topics for DARPA research, and a founder of the USC\/ICT, where she served as Senior Scientist for 14 years.
