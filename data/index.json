Her training is in two distinct, but complementary areas: the Learning Sciences and Cognitive Neuroscience. She utilizes eye tracking and neuroimaging to investigate the interactions between psychophysiological processes and educational outcomes. Her research focuses on fostering attention regulation and cognitive skills through enriching virtual learning contexts. Her primary work examines how physically-active video games enhance cognitive development and neuroplasticity in at-risk populations. As technology use grows at an exponential rate and sedentary behavior increases in the wake of the global pandemic, evidence-based practices that promote both physical activity and cognitive engagement are needed. She advocates for Educational Neuroscience, the emerging field that fosters collaborations in neuroscience, psychology, human-computer interaction, educational technology, and related disciplines to explore how learning experiences support brain development and cognitive skills crucial for academic achievement and success.","post_title":"Cassondra Eng","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"cassondra-eng","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2022-11-30 17:32:27","post_modified_gmt":"2022-11-30 17:32:27","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/webxrsummitseries\/profile\/cassondra-eng\/","menu_order":0,"post_type":"profile","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},"post_type":"profile","meta":{"profile_title":["Researcher","Researcher"],"company":["Stanford University","Stanford University"],"linkedin":["https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/cassondra-eng\/","https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/cassondra-eng\/"],"_edit_lock":["1669829547:1"],"_edit_last":["1","1"],"suppress_profile_page":["0","0"],"PhD":["0","0"],"timezone":["-7| PDT","-7| PDT"],"_yoast_wpseo_estimated-reading-time-minutes":["1","1"],"email":["cassondraeng@gmail.com","cassondraeng@gmail.com"],"website":["https:\/\/cassondraeng.github.io\/","https:\/\/cassondraeng.github.io\/"],"use_aframe":["0"],"invitation_sent":["1"],"calendar_sent":["0"],"calendar_confirmed":["0"],"signed_release":["0"],"first_name":["Cassondra"],"_thumbnail_id":["3551"],"_yoast_wpseo_content_score":["90"],"sort_name":["Eng, Cassondra"],"_yoast_wpseo_wordproof_timestamp":[""]},"thumbnail":false,"children":[]},"3548":{"ID":3548,"title":"Eleni Mangina","content":"","attr_title":"","url":"\/profile\/eleni-mangina\/","slug":"eleni-mangina","parent":"3239","coords":"","confirmation_status":"","point_of_contact":"","guest_type":"","event_type":"","notes":"","classes":[""],"post":{"ID":3547,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2022-06-24 00:31:58","post_date_gmt":"2022-06-24 00:31:58","post_content":"\u003C!-- wp:paragraph --\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EEleni Mangina carried out her PhD work at the University of Strathclyde (UK), Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, working on Agent-based applications for intelligent data interpretation (1998-2001).

I am looking at how the activity of these teams can be configured to project-based learning, and how this learning can be used to complement or challenge existing post-secondary pedagogical approaches to language, culture and heritage learning.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003C!-- \/wp:paragraph --\u003E","post_title":"Lucia Binotti","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"lucia-binotti","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2022-11-30 16:47:23","post_modified_gmt":"2022-11-30 16:47:23","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/webxrsummitseries\/profile\/lucia-binotti\/","menu_order":0,"post_type":"profile","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},"post_type":"profile","meta":{"profile_title":["Professor","Professor"],"company":["University of North Carolina Chapel Hill","University of North Carolina Chapel Hill"],"linkedin":["https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/luciabinotti\/","https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/luciabinotti\/"],"_edit_lock":["1669826844:1"],"_edit_last":["1"],"suppress_profile_page":["0"],"PhD":["0"],"timezone":["-7| PDT"],"_yoast_wpseo_estimated-reading-time-minutes":["1"],"email":["lbinotti@email.unc.edu","lbinotti@email.unc.edu"],"use_aframe":["0"],"invitation_sent":["1"],"calendar_sent":["0"],"calendar_confirmed":["0"],"signed_release":["0"],"first_name":["Lucia"],"twitter":["https:\/\/twitter.com\/lbinotti"],"discord":["Lucia B.#4945"],"_thumbnail_id":["3426"],"_yoast_wpseo_content_score":["60"],"registration_pending":["0"],"request_profile_update":["0"],"no_profile_link":["0"],"sort_name":["Binotti, Lucia"],"_yoast_wpseo_wordproof_timestamp":[""]},"thumbnail":false,"children":[]},{"ID":3197,"title":"Michael McDonald","content":"","attr_title":"","url":"\/profile\/michael-mcdonald\/","slug":"michael-mcdonald","parent":"2824","coords":"","confirmation_status":"","point_of_contact":"","guest_type":"","event_type":"","notes":"","classes":[""],"post":{"ID":2892,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2022-04-14 18:50:17","post_date_gmt":"2022-04-14 18:50:17","post_content":"\u003C!-- wp:paragraph --\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter a combined 20 years of studying and teaching foreign languages, Michael McDonald created Gold Lotus which aims to demonstrate how virtual reality can support the learning and teaching of foreign languages.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003C!-- \/wp:paragraph --\u003E\n\n\u003C!-- wp:paragraph --\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ERecent projects include the launch of the Handy English VR vocabulary-building app, a 24-hour VR English lesson and cultural event to raise funds for the fight against Covid and programs in schools around the world aimed at raising awareness of how VR can be used to develop language skills and cultural awareness, with particular focus on students building their own webXR spaces to share their local cultural heritage in a unique VR exchange program.

For over a decade he led VFX teams in Hollywood with significant roles at Warner Bros. Disney, DreamQuest and DreamWorks. Notable awards include: The recent prestigious Polys WebXR Awards 2021 with 3 wins for Experience of the year, Education experience of the year, and Video experience of the year for \u2018The Magic of Flight\u2019 XR experience, AIXR VR Awards 2021 nomination, DreamWorks Achievement Award, Kung-Fu Panda\u2019s 2008 Academy Award Nomination for Best Animated Feature of the year, as well as winning the 36th Annual Annie Awards in 10 categories, including Best Animated Feature, \u2018The High Ground Award\u2019 strategy war games, between M.I.T Sloan Fellows and Harvard Business School, and has served as judge for the Animation Oscars. A visionary, inventor and a Metaverse pioneer, Haggai pursuit of the Metaverse and related Extended Reality (XR) and Enhanced Reality (ER) technologies (e.g 3D,VFX, AR,VR, MR) span over 20 years. At DreamWorks he managed key innovation, development and integration of the Academy award-winning \"Shrek\" facial system, adapting it to DreamWorks' animated features franchise pipeline. By enabling animators to convey emotions through facial expressions as never before, the Shrek facial system, was the breakthrough that allowed Shrek to be the first computer- animated film ever to put digital human characters in leading roles, leading it to become the highest- grossing animated franchise of all times, with over $3.5B in revenues. In 2006, Haggai launched a tech startup out of M.I.T focused on the innovation of the next generation natural human interface for the Metaverse. His innovation lab created key technologies and XR experiences that preceded commercial VR headsets including avatar interaction, head, facial and eye tracking, gestural and haptic. At Microsoft Haggai led Mixed Reality (MR) initiatives and R&amp;D prototyping on HoloLens including the first shareable HoloLens Mixed Reality experience development at Microsoft which preceded \u201cMesh\u201d. Most recently Haggai led XR strategy at Meta driving global XR initiatives, partnerships and teams in NA, APAC and EMEA. Notably, he produced and oversaw the creation and deployment for the first WebXR\/OpenXR project, Project Origami: \u201cThe Magic of Flight\u201d.

I am looking at how the activity of these teams can be configured to project-based learning, and how this learning can be used to complement or challenge existing post-secondary pedagogical approaches to language, culture and heritage learning.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003C!-- \/wp:paragraph --\u003E","post_title":"Lucia Binotti","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"lucia-binotti","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2022-11-30 16:47:23","post_modified_gmt":"2022-11-30 16:47:23","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/webxrsummitseries\/profile\/lucia-binotti\/","menu_order":0,"post_type":"profile","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},"post_type":"profile","meta":{"profile_title":["Professor","Professor"],"company":["University of North Carolina Chapel Hill","University of North Carolina Chapel Hill"],"linkedin":["https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/luciabinotti\/","https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/luciabinotti\/"],"_edit_lock":["1669826844:1"],"_edit_last":["1"],"suppress_profile_page":["0"],"PhD":["0"],"timezone":["-7| PDT"],"_yoast_wpseo_estimated-reading-time-minutes":["1"],"email":["lbinotti@email.unc.edu","lbinotti@email.unc.edu"],"use_aframe":["0"],"invitation_sent":["1"],"calendar_sent":["0"],"calendar_confirmed":["0"],"signed_release":["0"],"first_name":["Lucia"],"twitter":["https:\/\/twitter.com\/lbinotti"],"discord":["Lucia B.#4945"],"_thumbnail_id":["3426"],"_yoast_wpseo_content_score":["60"],"registration_pending":["0"],"request_profile_update":["0"],"no_profile_link":["0"],"sort_name":["Binotti, Lucia"],"_yoast_wpseo_wordproof_timestamp":[""]},"thumbnail":false,"children":[]},"company":"University of North Carolina Chapel Hill","profile_title":"Professor","sort":"Binotti, Lucia","slug":"lucia-binotti","events":[{"event_id":2794,"event_slug":"webxr-education-summit","event_key":"edsummit22","event_title":"WebXR Education Summit","session_id":2777,"session_key":2824,"session_title":"Championing Arts and Humanities in Tech-Enabled Education","session_embed_video_url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/063X3sMQTqU","session_video_url":null}]},"michael-mcdonald":{"id":2892,"profile":{"ID":3197,"title":"Michael McDonald","content":"","attr_title":"","url":"\/profile\/michael-mcdonald\/","slug":"michael-mcdonald","parent":"2824","coords":"","confirmation_status":"","point_of_contact":"","guest_type":"","event_type":"","notes":"","classes":[""],"post":{"ID":2892,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2022-04-14 18:50:17","post_date_gmt":"2022-04-14 18:50:17","post_content":"\u003C!-- wp:paragraph --\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter a combined 20 years of studying and teaching foreign languages, Michael McDonald created Gold Lotus which aims to demonstrate how virtual reality can support the learning and teaching of foreign languages.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003C!-- \/wp:paragraph --\u003E\n\n\u003C!-- wp:paragraph --\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ERecent projects include the launch of the Handy English VR vocabulary-building app, a 24-hour VR English lesson and cultural event to raise funds for the fight against Covid and programs in schools around the world aimed at raising awareness of how VR can be used to develop language skills and cultural awareness, with particular focus on students building their own webXR spaces to share their local cultural heritage in a unique VR exchange program.

The video can be found here: https:\/\/youtu.be\/wsJF1ugsfKI\n\nRolando graduated from Yale University with a focus on Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology. During his studies co-founded Shuflix with his brothers, the largest activity search engine (at the time), to help people interact with their environment in a playful alternative way while helping small businesses get more exposure. Since then, he has also co-founded PhDx, a platform to help incoming PhD students with guides and insider knowledge of the unspoken rules in academia.\n\nIn his free time, Rolando is a filmmaker, composes for films, creates augmented reality tutorials for his YouTube channel, and does pro-bono marketing consulting for personal brands and small businesses.","post_title":"Rolando Mas\u00eds-Obando","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"rolando-masis-obando","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2022-11-30 17:01:22","post_modified_gmt":"2022-11-30 17:01:22","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/webxrsummitseries\/profile\/rolando-masis-obando\/","menu_order":0,"post_type":"profile","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},"post_type":"profile","meta":{"profile_title":["Neuroscientist + Filmmaker","Neuroscientist + Filmmaker"],"company":["Princeton University","Princeton University"],"resources":[null],"_edit_lock":["1669827684:1"],"_edit_last":["1"],"suppress_profile_page":["0"],"PhD":["0"],"use_aframe":["0"],"registration_pending":["0"],"invitation_sent":["0"],"calendar_sent":["0"],"calendar_confirmed":["0"],"signed_release":["0"],"request_profile_update":["0"],"no_profile_link":["0"],"timezone":["-7| PDT"],"_yoast_wpseo_estimated-reading-time-minutes":["1"],"linkedin":["https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/rmasiso\/","https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/rmasiso\/"],"email":["rolandomasisobando@gmail.com","rolandomasisobando@gmail.com"],"twitter":["https:\/\/twitter.com\/xrmasiso","https:\/\/twitter.com\/xrmasiso"],"_thumbnail_id":["3885"],"_yoast_wpseo_content_score":["30"],"first_name":["Rolando"],"website":["https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/c\/xrmasiso"],"sort_name":["Mas\u00eds-Obando, Rolando"],"_yoast_wpseo_wordproof_timestamp":[""]},"thumbnail":false,"children":[]},"company":"Princeton University","profile_title":"Neuroscientist + Filmmaker","sort":"Mas\u00eds-Obando, Rolando","slug":"rolando-masis-obando","events":[{"event_id":2794,"event_slug":"webxr-education-summit","event_key":"edsummit22","event_title":"WebXR Education Summit","session_id":2756,"session_key":2763,"session_title":"Safety, Privacy, and Ethical Design in XR for Education","session_embed_video_url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/kL8n34EEbEA","session_video_url":null},{"event_id":3934,"event_slug":"webxr-production-summit","event_key":"prodsummit22","event_title":"WebXR Production Summit","session_id":3928,"session_key":3935,"session_title":"Democratizing WebXR","session_embed_video_url":"https:\/\/youtube.com\/embed\/WJ3wiBCGVY8","session_video_url":null}]},"michael-avis":{"id":3477,"profile":{"ID":3478,"title":"Michael Avis","content":"","attr_title":"","url":"\/profile\/michael-avis\/","slug":"michael-avis","parent":"3266","coords":"","confirmation_status":"","point_of_contact":"","guest_type":"","event_type":"","notes":"","classes":[""],"post":{"ID":3477,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2022-06-20 13:03:57","post_date_gmt":"2022-06-20 13:03:57","post_content":"\u003C!-- wp:paragraph --\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMichael has worked in the educational sector for over twenty years and has taught at the primary, secondary, college, and university levels both domestically and internationally.

She utilizes eye tracking and neuroimaging to investigate the interactions between psychophysiological processes and educational outcomes. Her research focuses on fostering attention regulation and cognitive skills through enriching virtual learning contexts. Her primary work examines how physically-active video games enhance cognitive development and neuroplasticity in at-risk populations. As technology use grows at an exponential rate and sedentary behavior increases in the wake of the global pandemic, evidence-based practices that promote both physical activity and cognitive engagement are needed.

I thrive on blazing fresh trails, come up with the most viable product for the challenges at hand and then convince leaders to boldly move forward.","post_title":"Benno Erhardt","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"benno-ekhardt","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2022-11-30 15:12:43","post_modified_gmt":"2022-11-30 15:12:43","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"https:\/\/webxrsummitseries\/profile\/benno-ekhardt\/","menu_order":0,"post_type":"profile","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},"post_type":"profile","meta":{"email":["benkedesigns@gmail.com","benkedesigns@gmail.com"],"company":["Hilti","Hilti"],"resources":[null],"linkedin":["https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/bennokerhardt\/","https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/bennokerhardt\/"],"_edit_lock":["1669821164:1"],"_edit_last":["1"],"suppress_profile_page":["0"],"PhD":["0"],"use_aframe":["0"],"registration_pending":["0"],"invitation_sent":["0"],"calendar_sent":["0"],"calendar_confirmed":["0"],"signed_release":["0"],"request_profile_update":["0"],"no_profile_link":["0"],"timezone":["-7| PDT"],"_yoast_wpseo_estimated-reading-time-minutes":["1"],"first_name":["Benno"],"profile_title":["Storytelling and Digital Design"],"website":["http:\/\/www.hilti.group"],"twitter":["https:\/\/twitter.com\/brandingincars"],"_thumbnail_id":["4256"],"_yoast_wpseo_content_score":["30"],"_yoast_wpseo_wordproof_timestamp":[""],"sort_name":["Erhardt, Benno"]},"thumbnail":false,"children":[]},"company":"Hilti","profile_title":"Storytelling and Digital Design","sort":"Erhardt, Benno","slug":"benno-ekhardt","events":[{"event_id":3740,"event_slug":"webxr-brand-summit","event_key":"brandsummit22","event_title":"WebXR Brand Summit","session_id":3521,"session_key":3523,"session_title":"Case Study: Hilti\u2019s 3D Brand Guidelines Experience","session_embed_video_url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/?v=xW5DsNYUIHI&list=PLKNvd3dXSaxD1llq1hZq9T5wzdj-pLelX&index=20","session_video_url":null}]},"james-kaplan":{"id":3662,"profile":{"ID":3773,"title":"James Kaplan","content":"","attr_title":"","url":"\/profile\/james-kaplan\/","slug":"james-kaplan","parent":"3524","coords":"","confirmation_status":"prerecord","point_of_contact":"ben","guest_type":"interviewee","event_type":"","notes":"","classes":[""],"post":{"ID":3662,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2022-06-28 19:01:43","post_date_gmt":"2022-06-28 19:01:43","post_content":"James Kaplan is the Co-Founder and CEO of MeetKai Inc., a Conversational AI and metaverse company shaping the next-gen of artificial speech intelligence.

For over a decade he led VFX teams in Hollywood with significant roles at Warner Bros. Disney, DreamQuest and DreamWorks. Notable awards include: The recent prestigious Polys WebXR Awards 2021 with 3 wins for Experience of the year, Education experience of the year, and Video experience of the year for \u2018The Magic of Flight\u2019 XR experience, AIXR VR Awards 2021 nomination, DreamWorks Achievement Award, Kung-Fu Panda\u2019s 2008 Academy Award Nomination for Best Animated Feature of the year, as well as winning the 36th Annual Annie Awards in 10 categories, including Best Animated Feature, \u2018The High Ground Award\u2019 strategy war games, between M.I.T Sloan Fellows and Harvard Business School, and has served as judge for the Animation Oscars. A visionary, inventor and a Metaverse pioneer, Haggai pursuit of the Metaverse and related Extended Reality (XR) and Enhanced Reality (ER) technologies (e.g 3D,VFX, AR,VR, MR) span over 20 years. At DreamWorks he managed key innovation, development and integration of the Academy award-winning \"Shrek\" facial system, adapting it to DreamWorks' animated features franchise pipeline. By enabling animators to convey emotions through facial expressions as never before, the Shrek facial system, was the breakthrough that allowed Shrek to be the first computer- animated film ever to put digital human characters in leading roles, leading it to become the highest- grossing animated franchise of all times, with over $3.5B in revenues. In 2006, Haggai launched a tech startup out of M.I.T focused on the innovation of the next generation natural human interface for the Metaverse. His innovation lab created key technologies and XR experiences that preceded commercial VR headsets including avatar interaction, head, facial and eye tracking, gestural and haptic. At Microsoft Haggai led Mixed Reality (MR) initiatives and R&amp;D prototyping on HoloLens including the first shareable HoloLens Mixed Reality experience development at Microsoft which preceded \u201cMesh\u201d. Most recently Haggai led XR strategy at Meta driving global XR initiatives, partnerships and teams in NA, APAC and EMEA.
